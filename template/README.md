# Template

## Breif

This is a template tjat is used as the basis for all of the advent of code 
challenges. the idea being that by simply updating a template i will save myself
time with busy work.

## Approach

The idea is that we standadise as much as possible by the use of cmake variables
this is not the most readable but as the cmake files are small i am okay with it

## Usage

you should simply need to update the CURRENT_PROJECT_NAME and the rest should
fall into place. with a programe called your target name and a test with the
prefix test_ being generated
